                    <h1>Townlands</h1>
                    <p>Lowest level of Ireland's adminitrative boundary</p>
                    <p><code>admin_level=10</code></p>
                    <p>Very old - Date back about 1,000 years</p>
                    <p>Very small - Traditionally the amount of land one extended family could live off.</p>

                <section>
                    <h1>Why?</h1>
                    <h2>Addresses</h2>
                    <p>Anyone geocoded Irish addresses? It's a mess.</p>
                    <p>Houses in rural Ireland don't have house numbers, instead using "House Name, Townland, Nearby Town, County"</p>
                    <p>Townlands are important for geocoding many addresses.</p>
                    <p>Newly introduced postcode system (Eircode) might change that</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h1>Why?</h1>
                    <h2>Other administrative boundaries</h2>
                    <p>Atomic unit of other administrative boundaries</p>
                    <p>Larger administrative boundaries are made up of townlands.</p>
                    <p>Electoral Divisions (NUTS LAU), Constituancies</p>
                    <p>Can now add those to OSM</p>
                    <p>Can now use Irish official government data</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h1>Why?</h1>
                    <h2>History and Heritage</h2>
                    <p>Part of Ireland's cultural heritage and should be preserved and spread.</p>
                    <p>19th century census records are sorted by townlands.</p>
                    <p>Helps people searching for Irish ancestry/geneology</p>

                    <p>Or other borders. Only counties (<code>admin_level=6</code>)</p>
